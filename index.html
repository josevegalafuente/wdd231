      <div class="card-body">
        <p>
          My name is José Vega. I was born in a city in the south of Bolivia called Tarija, and I am currently focused on growing within the technology field. I work in a technology company related to artificial intelligence, while also dedicating time and effort to building my own company called Chief, which is centered on web development and AI-driven solutions.

One of the things I value most about technology and artificial intelligence is the ability to understand where we might be headed in the future. Technology offers incredible possibilities, and it truly excites me to explore how innovation can shape our lives and open new perspectives. This constant evolution motivates me to keep learning and improving my skills.
        </p>
        <p>I have a strong interest in graphic design, especially in combining colors and shapes to create visual harmony. I enjoy imagining new ways to connect ideas and aesthetics, giving projects a fresh and meaningful perspective. I believe design has the power to communicate ideas in a unique and impactful way.

In my free time, I enjoy running and training in boxing, as staying active helps me maintain both physical and mental balance. My family is extremely important to me, and they are a central part of my life. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and I strive to serve the members of my local ward whenever I can.</p>
        <p>I believe in Jesus Christ as our Savior, and I know that through Him we can find peace, happiness, and strength in this life, especially within our families. I am excited to integrate faith, learning, and technology in this journey, using the skills I gain to help others, strengthen my family, and continue progressing personally and professionally.</p>
